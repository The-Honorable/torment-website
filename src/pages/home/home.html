            Welcome to Torment. My mod I created to be a harder vanilla, but rebalance and add many more items, monsters, and suprises along the way.

            The mod is very work in progress, and at the early stages of development. There will be some bugs, and some things that are not fully fleshed out. But I hope you enjoy the ride as I continue to develop it.
